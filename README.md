# LED-Brightness-Control

A control systems course work project that demonstrates the implementation of a Proportional-Integrative-Derivative Controller to regulate the brightness of LED.PID is essentially used wherein the desired performance is reached by adjusting the output continuosly based on difference between desired setpoint and measured process variable, in this project the process variable is brightness of LED. 

Steps involved 
1) Simulink model is created with blocks representing the LED , Potentiometer , PID Controller and other components.
2) Configuring PID Controller with appropriate parameter Kp, Ki, Kd for controlling LED Brightness.
3) Run Simulations and fine tune PID parameters
4) Simulink model may be deployed to hardware
